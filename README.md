understanding what to do
My name is Alana and I am a middle school teacher.  I am trying to teach myself to code because I think that it will be cool and useful.  This is something that I have only played with before and I think that it will be interesting to really use it to do something in real life.
My kids would struggle with writing about themselves but I find it theraputic.  I didn't think that I would think the same about typing but here I am.
Usually I write information down and not type.
